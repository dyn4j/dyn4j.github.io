A few services ago we had one of our Youth Ministers preach. The topic wasn't necessarily about the Biblical teaching of One God, however some verses used in the sermon really stand out:

John 14:26  
But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your rememberance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

John 15:26  
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:

It may seem like a contradiction, however, if you believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one God (yet different manifestations), then this makes perfect sense. I like to look at it as Jesus speaking in the 3rd person in John 14:26 and 1st person in John 15:26 when he refers to sending the Comforter. Many times in the Bible when Jesus speaks, he changes they way that he speaks to fit those who he is talking to.

These particularly stand out to me since they are both words spoken by Jesus (red letter edition), they are within the same book, within one chapter of each other, and the same verse number.

In addition, it's interesting to me because it resembles a logical proof. One method of proving a theory as true or false is to assume the opposite of what you are trying to prove is true and then find a contradiction. This does exactly that.

Anyway, just figured I would share this.
