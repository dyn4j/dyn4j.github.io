This release of dyn4j is a maintenance release to fix a bug in the Segment.getSegmentIntersection method.  A new method, setSlackEnabled, was also added to the PulleyJoint class to support a rope like constraint.  See the changes in the <a title="Release Notes" href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a>.

This release should not contain any breaking changes.

No new release of the Sandbox was published for this release.
