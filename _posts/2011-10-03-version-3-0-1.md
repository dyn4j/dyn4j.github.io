3.0.1 incorporates many small changes. JUnit test, the TestBed and a new testing/demo application, Sandbox, have been moved around to better structure the project. Many major and minor bug fixes have been made. The most visible change is the normalization of the Joint class methods. In addition, the WeldJoint class now supports a soft joint setting.

> When running either test application you may be asked to accept a certificate from me (I just self signed the JARs). The certificates will expire six months from today&#8230;

Both applications require Java 1.6+.

In the TestBed application, be sure to type the &#8220;c&#8221; key to get the TestBed Control Panel so you can play with the simulator. Use the Controls tab to view all the key board and mouse options. Use the Tests tab to run a test of your choosing. Use the Draw Options tab to set what is drawn to the screen. And finally, use the Simulation Settings tab to play with all the different settings allowed by the engine.

In the Sandbox application, use the menus, toolbar and the tree (right click for context menus) to run tests, save them, add bodies/joints, etc.
