3.0.1 incorporates many small changes. JUnit test, the TestBed and a new testing/demo application, Sandbox, have been moved around to better structure the project. Many major and minor bug fixes have been made. The most visible change is the normalization of the Joint class methods. In addition, the WeldJoint class now supports a soft joint setting.
