This release of dyn4j is a maintenance release to fix bugs in the Ellipse.contains, Ellipse.getHalfHeight and HalfEllipse.contains methods.  This release also had a bug fix in the Graphics2DRenderer class.  See the change detail in the <a title="Release Notes" href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a>.

This release has one breaking change: the Ellipse.getPointClosestToPoint method has been removed.  This method was based on an incorrect assumption and was removed for the time being.

No new release of the Sandbox was published for this release.
