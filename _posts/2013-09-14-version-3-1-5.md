This release of dyn4j includes a number of new features including 4 new primitive shapes and convex casting.  In addition, a number of new helper methods have been added to the Geometry class.  See all the changes in the <a title="Release Notes"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a>.

This release should not contain any breaking changes unless you were using anything in the org.dyn4j.collision.continuous package directly.

The output of the convex casting features may be tweaked in future releases.

No new release of the Sandbox was published for this release.
