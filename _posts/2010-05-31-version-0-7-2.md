It's been a while and to be honest I haven't completed much (as far as implementation). However, the current version of the project is now 0.7.2 so at least you can see we are getting closer to release. The latest version contains a number of improvements and two joints. The testbed received a little face lift and the tests have been tweeked for consistency.

I've been a bit side tracked with real life and explanations of the algorithms used in dyn4j on my [blog](/blog/).

I created a new testbed pre-release in addition to show some of the changes made.
