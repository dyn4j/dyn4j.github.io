This version features a number of improvements to API (and deprecation) and massive performance improvements (30-40%) for large worlds.

<!--more-->

A lot of API was deprecated, but much of it will be very simple to update.  There are a few breaking changes as well, but these should be minor.  Please review the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md');"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a> for all the details.
