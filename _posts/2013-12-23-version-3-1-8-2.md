This release of dyn4j is a maintenance release to fix a bug in the Vector2.distance(double,double) method.  It also had a few methods added to the Body class to get BodyFixture(s) at a given world space point.  See the change detail in the <a title="Release Notes" href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a>.

A new release of the Sandbox was published for this release due to changes in WebStart security and an API change by JOGL.
