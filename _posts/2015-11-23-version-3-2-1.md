This is a maintenance release to fix a few critical bugs in the Polygon, Rectangle, and Segment classes for local rotations (see <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/forum.dyn4j.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=255');"  href="http://forum.dyn4j.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=255" target="_blank">this post</a> for details).

This release also contains some small enhancements (a few new methods) to some of the joints and a complete rewrite of all the joint class javadoc documentation. Â The documentation should be much easier to read and should explain common use.
