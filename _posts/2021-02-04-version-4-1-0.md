This release sees some huge performance improvements for CCD (around 10x for large worlds). Along with the performance enhancements came improvements to CCD as a whole, a more generic broadphase, lots of additional unit tests and greatly improved test quality.

That said, it definitely has some breaking changes. All deprecated API has been removed as well.
