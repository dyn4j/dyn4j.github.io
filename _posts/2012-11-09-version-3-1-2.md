This release of dyn4j is a small maintenance release to add unique contact ids to the engine. This allows you identify a contact throughout the ContactListener events (begin, persist, end, etc). You can test if a contact is the same as another by using the ContactId.equals method.

This release should not contain any breaking changes unless you were manually creating ContactPoints or subclasses thereof. See the <a title="Latest Release Notes"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Release Notes</a> for more details.

No new release of the Sandbox was published for this release.
