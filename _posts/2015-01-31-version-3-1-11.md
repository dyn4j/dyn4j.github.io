This is a maintenance release of dyn4j that includes a bug fix for a StackOverflowException thrown from the raycast(Ray, double, boolean, boolean, List) method.  This release also includes some very minor performance tweaks. See the change detail in the <a title="Release Notes"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md">release notes</a>.

The Sandbox app was updated to fix a bug in the Java code exporter (Rays were not being exported).
