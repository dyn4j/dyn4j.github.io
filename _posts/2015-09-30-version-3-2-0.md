The primary goals for this release were performance enhancements and API clean up.  It took a lot longer than I had expected but I&#8217;m very happy with the results.  Highlights include improvements in the performance of collision detection and ray casting operations and a much cleaner public API and more thorough javadoc comments.

The API has been changed a good bit and you&#8217;ll find some breaking changes.  Most, if not all, should be simple find/replace changes, the behavior should remain the same.  Those of note are:

  1. Body.setMass() was deprecated.  Use Body.setMass(MassType) instead.
  2. Mass.Type was renamed to MassType.
  3. MouseJoint was renamed to PinJoint.

All this got me thinking of the old days of the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button');"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button" target="_blank">Turbo button</a> which funny enough did the opposite of what you&#8217;d think&#8230;
