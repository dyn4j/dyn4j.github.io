Due to Google&#8217;s <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html');" title="Google Dropping Google Code"  href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision to drop Google Code</a>, I&#8217;ve moved the project to <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/');" title="dyn4j on GitHub"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.  In truth, I&#8217;ve been contemplating this for a while now, but have had reservations about lost version history.  I feel this will help others contribute bug fixes and allow them to create their own forks and branches easier than before.

I haven&#8217;t fully check the revision history, but it looks like everything came over as expected.  I had to manually move all the wiki pages, but I was planning to do this anyway as well.  You can find them under Documentation on dyn4j.org.
