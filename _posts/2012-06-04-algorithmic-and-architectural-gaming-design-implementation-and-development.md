But what sets this book apart, in my opinion, is the focus on actual implementation.

Of course I&#8217;m a bit biased since I was privileged to write the chapter _Collision Detection Using the GJK Algorithm_ (chapter 11). The chapter is about 35 pages long and covers a 2D implementation and explanation of GJK and related algorithms.

Throughout the chapter I explain the concepts with concrete examples and pseudo code. At the end of the last three sections I talk about the robustness of each, focusing on floating point problems and special cases.

Here&#8217;s a breif summary of the topics covered in the GJK chapter:

  * Introduction to Collision Detection
  * Convexity
  * Minkwoski Sum
  * SAT-GJK (GJK w/o the distance sub algo.)
  * GJK Distance and Closest Points
  * EPA

Big thanks to the editors of the book for allowing me this great opportunity and an even bigger thanks to my Savior Jesus Christ.
