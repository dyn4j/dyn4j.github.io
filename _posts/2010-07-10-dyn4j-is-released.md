The first release of dyn4j is out!

It's taken me a while but I think its release ready. You can download the release on the Google Code project site <a href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/">here</a>. All the Javadocs, features, and getting started pages have been updated accordingly. In addition to this the forums have been opened.

There is still a lot to accomplish as you can see by the Features page. Two items on there, Raycasts and CCD may require some API changes and will be large changes none-the-less.
