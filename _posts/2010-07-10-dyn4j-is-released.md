The first release of dyn4j is out!

It&#8217;s taken me a while but I think its release ready. You can download the release on the Google Code project site <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/');"  href="https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/">here</a>. All the Javadocs, features, and getting started pages have been updated accordingly. In addition to this the forums have been opened.

> When running you may be asked to accept a certificate from me (I just self signed the JARs). The certificates will expire six months from today&#8230;

All the releases require Java 1.6+. Be sure to type the &#8220;c&#8221; key to get the TestBed Control Panel so you can play with the simulator.

Use the Controls tab to view all the key board and mouse options. Use the Tests tab to run a test of your choosing. Use the Draw Options tab to set what is drawn to the screen. And finally, use the Simulation Settings tab to play with all the different settings allowed by the engine.

There is still a lot to accomplish as you can see by the Features page. Two items on there, Raycasts and CCD may require some API changes and will be large changes none-the-less.
