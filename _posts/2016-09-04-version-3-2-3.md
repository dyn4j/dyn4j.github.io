This release fixes issues with the getRadius(Vector2) method for the Slice, Capsule, Ellipse, and HalfEllipse shapes under local rotation and fixes the detect(AABB) method in the Sap broadphase.

Sadly, the getRadius(Vector2) method for the Ellipse classes boils down to a maximization/root finding problem. Â Thankfully, the method should be called rarely so should have negligible performance impact.
