message: "<p>Thanks William. I am having trouble with some parts of the derivation.</p>\n<p>I understand as follows:</p>\n<p>We have u initially as the relative position between the two bodies, which is transformed with one of the bodies.</p>\n<p>t is always perpendicular to u</p>\n<p>In your code, you are using the specified legal axis, and the tangent axis, and additionally, the relative position.</p>\n<p>So since you have the original equation as</p>\n<p>C = t.u = t.(xa + ra &#8211; xb &#8211; rb)<br />\ndC/dt = t.(va + Cross(wa,ra) &#8211; vb &#8211; Cross(wb,rb)) + Cross(wb,t).u</p>\n<p>and u = xa + ra &#8211; xb &#8211; rb</p>\n<p>Where do you incorporate the specified axis in the equation as you do in the code? All I see is t vectors in your derivation and the relative position u, and not the actual legal axis of movement.</p>\n<p>I understand that even if we specify the legal axis upon initialisation, this axis and the tangent vector to this axis can change with the movement of one of the bodies.</p>\n<p>Contrary to a revolute joint, where the relative position is always zero, we are saying the relative position between the two bodies can be non-zero only if the tangent vector is perpendicular to this relative position vector.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help</p>"
