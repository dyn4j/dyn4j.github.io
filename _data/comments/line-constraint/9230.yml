message: "<p>Thanks William, that does clear things up. </p>\n<p>I have managed to implement the 3D version, with two restricted tangent axis, thereby ending up with a 2&#215;2 matrix. The only difference is for 3D, you need to build an orthogonal basis from the supplied legal axis of movement and derive a second constraint identical to the one you derived.</p>"
