message: "<p>Yeah this is one of the more difficult parts to understand.  Basically, to perform the derivative, we need to know how u is defined (in terms of what? A single body? Both bodies? Is it fixed?).  Since we are doing pair-wise constraints we know that we want to have u in terms of both of the bodies so that their <em>relative</em> motion is constrained.  We can define the <em>position</em> constraint using the initial relative position vector of the two bodies relative to the anchor point (this is why we still have to supply an anchor).<br />\nTake a look at this image:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/line-arbitrary-vector.png\" style=\"border: 0px;\"/></p>\n<p>If either body moves (in this case I move only body b), we can't recompute u, since the constraint would always be satisfied.  That means that we compute u once, when the constraint is created, from the initial positions of the bodies.  But if we are doing that, why can't we just supply an axis rather than compute it? The answer is, we can, because the creator of the constraint could do the same thing if they just positioned the bodies appropriately upon creation of the constraint.  So if I were to position b in the second position in my image above initially, I could make the constraint use (1, 0) as the axis rather than (8, 6).</p>\n<p>I hope that clears things up a bit,<br />\nWilliam</p>"
