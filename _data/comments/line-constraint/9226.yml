message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>I have a a body at (-20,0,0) and an immovable body at (0,41,0). The world anchor point is at (-20,0,0). Therefore the initial world u vector should be along the line connecting the two body's center points? I am having trouble getting the simulation correct and trying the 2D case first.</p>\n<p>Also, at each frame I have Cross(wa, t) in the velocity equation, therefore the tangent vector should change with body A and be fixed relative to body B. </p>\n<p>Thanks for your help</p>"
