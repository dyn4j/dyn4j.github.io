message: "<p>@Jiang Jin hao</p>\n<p>You've probably found your answer already, but it's a good idea to respond since it will help others.  Take a look a slide 15 <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc09/slides/04-GDC09_Catto_Erin_Solver.pdf');\"  href=\"http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc09/slides/04-GDC09_Catto_Erin_Solver.pdf\" title=\"Equality Constraints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  This should explain where equation 2 comes from.  It contains a lot of other good information too.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
