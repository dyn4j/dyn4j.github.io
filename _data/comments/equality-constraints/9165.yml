message: "<p>We remove the external forces from the equation because they can be integrated (in other words, applied to the bodies) before we even attempt to solve any constraints.  Take gravity as an example.  Gravity will try to accelerate an object in a direction.  We can go ahead and apply that force to the bodies to get new velocities.  Afterwards, we can solve the constraints as normal using a much simpler equation.</p>\n<p>In short we remove those from the equation because we can apply them early (since any illegal movement will be removed by the constraints) and because it makes the solution for the constraints much simpler.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
