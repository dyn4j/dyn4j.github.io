message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>Thanks for your reply. That makes sense, although maybe I didn't explain my question well enough. I'll try to explain what I meant better, but please excuse me if any of the following is wrong as I'm still trying to figure it out :)</p>\n<p>What I meant was, say you have a system with several constraints (eg a weld joint between bodies 1 and 2, and a revolute joint between bodies 2 and 3). As you say, you can either create a large sparse matrix for all bodies that will have both of the constraints in it, and solve that, or you can apply an iterative method.<br />\nLike you described, the iterative method would work by solving each constraint in isolation, and then repeating this a number of times.</p>\n<p>Some constraints are made by composing others (for example the weld joint is a revolute joint combined with an angle joint). What I was wondering is, just as you can consider the two constraints I mentioned above in isolation (when solving iteratively), does this mean you could also consider the 2 constraints of the weld joint separately in the iterative solver?</p>\n<p>If I understand correctly, when fully expanded (rather than in block form) the Jacobian for the weld joint will actually have 3 rows, one for each degree of freedom removed.<br />\nThat is, there is a scalar constraint equation to restrict each of the X, Y and angle of one body relative to the other.<br />\nWhat I really was getting at was, can each of *these* be considered in isolation (as separate constraints) when writing an iterative solver?</p>\n<p>The reason I wanted to know that is because if K and lambda is scalar then lambda can be solved for directly, rather than having to worry about inverting K. And also from Catto's GDC 2009 presentation he seems to describe K and lambda as scalars, so I assumed that's what he meant, but then I see in the code he doesn't do that so I am confused.</p>\n<p>Hope that makes more sense.</p>"
