message: "<p>I'm not sure I understand the difference you are pointing out.  Are you saying that the derivation on the <a href=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/2010/12/line-constraint/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Line Constraint</a> Post is incorrect (since that is where I get the velocity constraint for the Prismatic Joint)?  Thanks for checking my work!</p>\n<p>William</p>"
