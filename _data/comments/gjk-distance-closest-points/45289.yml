message: "<p>Isn't it incorrect to simply check which point is further away from the origin and replace it with the new point?</p>\n<p>It is pretty easy to compe up with a case where A is further away than B, yet the closest point on the resulting triangle actually lies on the segment AC, whereas your algorithm will result with the line BC.</p>"
