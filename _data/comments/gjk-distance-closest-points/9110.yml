message: "<p>Thanks for your reply! By drifting I mean that the points leave the polygon and lag behind if you move the polygon around. It's perhaps a bit difficult to explain in text but it looks as if the closest points have a smaller radius of action.</p>\n<p>That's a good suggestion and thanks for your offer. I'll check if the points fall onto the sum shape. Maybe there is an error I can spot. </p>\n<p>I'll let you know!</p>\n<p>thanks,<br />\nErnst</p>"
