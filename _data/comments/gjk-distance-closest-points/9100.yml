message: "<p>In iteration 3, after finding the new direction d(0.62, -0.78), then the point in that direction should be (-4,-1). It is the same with the point added in the iteration 2. My reason is (-4,-1) dot (0.62,-0.78)=-1.7. It is larger than the dot product of (1,3) and (0.62,-0.78)=-1.72. Would you please tell me why you choose (1,3) here? Thanks very much.</p>"
