message: "<p>@shome</p>\n<p>It's been a while since I've looked into it. The only ones I remember coming across are Lin-Canny Closest Features Algorithm and another that was based off of it.  There was some question of one of those being patented so I didn't look too deep into those.</p>\n<p>In my experience, GJK will only slow down near convergence for rounded or ill-conditioned shapes.  If your shapes are all polytopes, then it should be lightning fast.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
