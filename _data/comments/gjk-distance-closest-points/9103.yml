message: "<p>I'm trying to use this case to see how to jump out of the loop. Starting with A(1,3) and B(-9,10), then doing triple cross product ABxAOxAB give the direction (-0.573,-0.819). Then I use all the vertices on the edge to dot product with the direction vector. For 3 vertices give positive values and vertex (-11,-1) gives the largest one (Question 1: Here, should I check if the simplex contains the origin?).  </p>\n<p>So (-11,-1) is added on as the new point A, same as in your post. Then I do the triple cross product to find the direction (0.316, -0.949) to search. doing dot product of all vertices with the new searching direction gives all negative values. So, question 2, does it mean the loop should be terminated here? or should I keep on searching in another direction until it leads back to the vertex that has already been checked before? Cuz when I keep on doing triple cross product to find the new point, it leads me to (-4,-1), and then back to (1,3) where I started. </p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for answering all my questions.</p>"
