message: "<p>I'm glad to hear you worked out your other problem.</p>\n<p>There are some corner cases to work out for sure.  Have you looked at my <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/collision/narrowphase/Gjk.java');\"  href=\"https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/collision/narrowphase/Gjk.java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2D implementation</a>?  I specifically try to handle the \"new point is <em>on</em> the simplex\" case.  This is probably not sufficient for 3D, but worth a look at if you haven't already.  You'll also notice that my loop gives up after a certain number of iterations as well.</p>\n<p>I haven't thought through all the corner cases that could be possible in 3D, but I've found that the best way to troubleshoot issues like these are to have a test application that can log the position/rotation of the objects after every move.  Then, when the corner case hits (the app crashing or hanging actually helps here), you can use the last printed data to setup a specific test that you can step through with a debugger (and pen+paper).</p>\n<p>William</p>"
