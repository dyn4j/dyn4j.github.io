message: "<p>How did you get a direction = (1, -3) in the beginning of second iteration?<br />\nThe closest point to origin from line segment (-11, -1) to (1, 3) is (-1.8, 2.4) so shouldn't this be the new direction?</p>\n<p>And to get a point on Minkowski difference that is closer to the origin shouldn't this be negated?<br />\nThe pseudo-code doesn't seem to do so, just takes the closest point on line segment as direction itself.</p>"
