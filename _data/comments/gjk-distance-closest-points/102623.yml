message: "<p>I mostly fixed it. I was just doing something dumb that was hard to notice. However there is still the problem of the occasional crash. Normally this happens when you try to test a single point against an axis aligned box. The algorithm gets stuck in a loop because the 4th point of the simplex it calculates later turns out to be the furthest point away, so that point gets removed from the simplex, and then re-added because it calculates the same point again. Do you have any advice to remedy this?</p>"
