message: "<p>I think you made a mistake in the section \"The distance\". If the t parameter is greater  than 1 or smaller that 0, which can happen with the dot product, you'll end up with a point that doesnt lie on the segment. The solution to that problem would be to clamp t to [0;1], in order to only get a point on the segment.</p>"
