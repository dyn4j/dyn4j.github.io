message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>I think he referred to the calculation of n in findClosestEdge(), using the triple product abxoaxab.<br />\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, but I think you get a reversed n pointing away from the origin.<br />\nYou can see it in line 10 of iteration 1, n=(-32, 96), would point away.<br />\nperhaps you should have used ao instead of oa.</p>\n<p>Roy</p>"
