message: "<p>If Polygon A = [(0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 4), (4, 0)]<br />\nand Polygon B = [(2, 3), (2, 7), (6, 7), (6, 3)]<br />\nthen EPA will give a penetration depth of 1 and a vector of (0, 1)<br />\nbut if A's velocity was (2, 0) and B's velocity was (-2, 0), the polygons' ys shouldn't change at all, so how is the info from EPA supposed to help?</p>"
