message: "<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>I have a little problem with the 3D EPA algorithm. Considering a box-box collision, there are cases when the algorithm doesn't terminate ever: the polytope is just getting bigger with redundant vertices.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to detect this? (besides limiting the number of iterations/vertices)</p>"
