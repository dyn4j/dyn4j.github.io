message: "<p>Hi!<br />\nI am a little confused:<br />\n1. EPA starts with a edge of Minkowski Difference(MD) so why simplex from GJK is needed?<br />\n2. In this example, the simplex is composed by two edges of MD so EPA tries to reach another edge of MD?</p>\n<p>Btw, your tutorials are awesome! Thanks!</p>"
