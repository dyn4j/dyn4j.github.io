message: "<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>I really like your walkthrough of the EPA algorithm! But I have a question.<br />\nYou talk a lot about the winding of the simplex, and I do understand how that would work in 2D, How would you do in 3d, as I am about to implement this in to my 3d game engine that already got GJK working nicely, it would be very practical if I knew this.</p>\n<p>Greetings from Sweden!<br />\nMr.Ful</p>"
