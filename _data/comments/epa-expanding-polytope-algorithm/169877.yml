message: "<p>Hi William<br />\nSpecial Thanks for this useful tutorial, now am very clear.</p>\n<p>my question is that for penetration depth between a single point and a convex object which algorithm is better?EPA or GJK distance or something else?</p>\n<p>and penetration depth is not too much deep or  even not very small (touching) something in the middle</p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing back from you</p>\n<p>Thanks Atia</p>"
