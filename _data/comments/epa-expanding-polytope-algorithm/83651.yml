message: "<p>Thanks for the great articles, they've really helped.</p>\n<p>I did some testing because I wanted to find the contact points after the EPA had terminated, and I found that by using the exact same technique using the Convex Collection and lambda expressions as in your GJK distance algorithm, I could use the final edge endpoints in Minkowski Space to find the two contact points in real space.</p>\n<p>You mention you have to expand on EPA or use another algorithm to find these, som I just thought I'd share the expansion.</p>"
