message: "<p>Typically I'm referring to the vector of minimum penetration of the two bodies as the normal (called the separation or collision normal).  Later I use the term in the Clipping section to identify a vector perpendicular to an edge.</p>\n<p>I qualified each time I used the word \"normal\" with either \"separation\" or \"edge\" to help clarify what I talking about.  I hope that takes care of the confusion (thanks for the comment).</p>\n<p>William</p>"
