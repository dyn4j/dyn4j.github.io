message: "<p>Hi William, I know this has been more than 7 years since you posted the article but it's still being used.<br />\nIt seems Peter was correct when saying only example 2 worked when you use (y, -x) to orthogonalize the ref vector. If you are using the right-hand rule as you say, it should be (-y, x). But then example 2 doesn't work.<br />\nI found that by using the inverted reference face normal (pointing inside the polygon), I get correct results for all three examples, the correct points are getting clipped. This also removes the need for the flip flag.</p>"
