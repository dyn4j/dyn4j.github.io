message: "<p>Thanks man!</p>\n<p>Sadly, I still haven't found a <em>fast</em> tool to make good sketches.  These were all made in Gimp just using a bunch of layers and time (at least there's an easy way to make a grid pattern).  If you'd like any of the gimp files for these just let me know,</p>\n<p>William</p>"
