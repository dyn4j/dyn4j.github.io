message: "<p>@Dylan</p>\n<p>This may depend on what you are using the results for.  For example, in my collision detection code I have a check at the end that makes sure the normal is always pointing from convex A to convex B.  The same applies here in that, if the reference edge was B, then I need to negate the front normal so that the normal is still pointing from A to B.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
