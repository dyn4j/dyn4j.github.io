message: "<p>First, I would like to thank you for this tutorial.  Been a great help implementing my physics engine.<br />\nBut I was a bit confused at the Edge. How is the edge structured?<br />\nDoes it contain 2 Vector3 that holds the data of the 2 vertices that forms the edge? or is it a vector from A to B?</p>"
