message: "<p>I have two questions, which are both related to coordinate systems:<br />\n1. What coordinate system do all the operations happen in? Is it each objects' local coordinates, or in world coordinates?<br />\n2. Will everything work in normal screen coordinates, or is this in standard Cartesian space?</p>\n<p>Sorry if this stuff should be obvious, as I'm new to making physics engines.</p>"
