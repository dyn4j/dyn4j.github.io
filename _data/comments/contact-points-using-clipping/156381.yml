message: "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>This article looks like it could complete my necessary collision processing for my physics engine, but there is one point I am confused on: how do I get the collision/seperation normal?  You begin this algorithm assuming it is found, but my current GJK algorithm simply returns true/false on a collision check.</p>"
