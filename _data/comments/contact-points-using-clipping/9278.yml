message: "<p>@Andrei</p>\n<p>Good catch, those should be normalized.  I've fixed it within the post.  In my implementations I use the normals (pre-normalized in local space) of the edges rather than the edges themselves to do this test so I can avoid the normalization every iteration.</p>\n<p>We don't need absolute value there because both the r and l vectors are pointing at the farthest point and because n is pointing in the same direction.  This will always yield a non-negative value.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
