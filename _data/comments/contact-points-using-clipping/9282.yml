message: "<p>Hi William,<br />\nI have trouble understanding the use of the ref vector. I thought it was an edge made from a maximum and two vectors representing the extremities, obtained from the best() method. However in the next code snippet you seem to be using it as a vector, as opposed to the incident edge, where you use it's v1 and v2 properties instead of the edge itself. Could you please shed some light on my comprehension issue?<br />\nThanks!</p>"
