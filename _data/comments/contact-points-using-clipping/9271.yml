And I appreciate the effort that went into it.</p>\n<p>I have one question though.<br />\nWhen using the variable max, to later clamp our points, what is ref.max referring to?</p>\n<pre>\ndouble max = refNorm.dot(ref.max);\n</pre>\n<p>Is that the furthest vertex in the reference edge using the reference edge's direction?</p>"
