message: "<p>@Bas</p>\n<p>It's hard to say what could be going wrong without seeing the code.  It should work for containment cases as well.  Are you doing any additional clipping operations for the faces?  The best thing would be to put the shapes in the failing configuration and then step through your code to see where/why they are missing.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
