message: "<p>Yeah, working in 3D is much harder since multiplying out the matrices symbolically is messy.  The good thing is, once you have identified the Jacobian you don't really have to go much further (one reason to go further is to find places where you can improve performance).  You can just use the equations below, fill in all the numbers and do the matrix multiplication then.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/weldc-9.png\" style=\"border: 0px;\"/><br />\nThis should yield a 6&#215;6 matrix (each row has 2 3&#215;3 columns).  To solve this we need to have a b vector that is 6&#215;1.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/weldc-6.png\" style=\"border: 0px;\"/><br />\nWe can see that the first row will yield a 3&#215;1 as will the bottom.  So we should be able to solve this 6 variable system using whatever linear equation solver you would like to use.  To solve this you must invert the 6&#215;6.  You can use <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination');\"  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination\" title=\"Gaussian Elimination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gaussian Elimination</a>, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition');\"  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition\" title=\"LU Decomposition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LU Decomposition</a>, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition');\"  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition\" title=\"Cholesky Decomposition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cholesky Decomposition</a>, etc just be careful of singularities and the respective algorithm's restrictions.</p>\n<p>Another option is to use an application like Mathematica (or something similar) to simplify the matrices symbolically (since it isn't really hard, just tedious).</p>\n<p>Hope that helps,<br />\nWilliam</p>"
