message: "<p>Thanks! I am sure you have implemented the 3D version and have better tips than me. I am however happy to send some c++ code if it helps anyone</p>\n<p>I have a question about the Jacobian. Some people say its a 3&#215;12</p>\n<p>[ 1    skew[ra]     -1       -skew[rb] ]</p>\n<p>Since we have two scalars and 2 3&#215;3 matrices, how would you arrange these to form a 3&#215;12 matrix? I am not that familiar with a matrix inside a matrix</p>"
