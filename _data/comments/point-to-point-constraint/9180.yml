message: "<p>Good question. To isolate the velocity terms we must convert the cross product into a matrix multiplication and depending on the number of dimensions you will get different Jacobians.</p>\n<p>In 2D the angular velocity, w, is a scalar and you can simply separate the scalar and matrix with a multiplication (as shown in the post).  Performing a transpose in 2D is not necessary, although, it may have made things easier to follow.  (For 2D using the transpose vs. not transpose will still yield the same jacobian, but only because w, I, and M are all scalars).</p>\n<p>However, in 3D you cannot do this since w is a vector and matrix multiplication is not commutative.  For 3D you must use <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication');\"  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication\" title=\"Cross Product to Matrix Multiplication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this formula</a> to separate the angular velocity.  You will need to use the second equation which gives you <strong>R</strong><sup>T</sup><strong>w</strong> so that you can further separate out the Jacobian but retain the order of matrix multiplication.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
