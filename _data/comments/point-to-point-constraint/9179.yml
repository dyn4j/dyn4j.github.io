message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>In the step where we want to isolate velocities, you have converted a vector into its corresponding skew-symmetric matrix.</p>\n<p>For two vectors a and b, and a skew symmetric matrix [A] of a,<br />\nwill b X a = [A] X b<br />\nor will b X a = (transpose of [A]) X b</p>\n<p>Such a formula would change the Jacobian to contain transposes of the skew symmetric matrices, instead of the skew symmetric matrices. Which one is right?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"
