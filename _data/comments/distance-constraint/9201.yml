message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>Thanks for the replies.<br />\nI am getting the right responses from the bodies when i've implemented the distance constraint, but there seems to be a constant drift arising out of the numerical integration errors. I've noticed this error for the point-to-point constraint also.<br />\nHow do we solve/cancel out these errors and ensure close-to-perfect behavior with the constraints?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>"
