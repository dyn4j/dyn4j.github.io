message: "<p>Yeah, that sounds reasonable.  I think a lot of 3D engines offer a generic 6DOF joint in which each degree of freedom is defined separately; sort of like what you describe.  Is it not working?</p>\n<p>I can't really offer much help unfortunately, as I haven't done any 3D joint derivations (nor can I find any good references...)</p>\n<p>William</p>"
