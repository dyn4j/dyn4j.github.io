message: "<p>Thank you so much for this post. I tried to implement it yesterday but couldn't get it to work. Today I threw all away and restarted implementing a clean collision approach.</p>\n<p>This time it works fine, though I don't really understand the mtv and how to implement it. But I got a nice approximation so I don't need the mtv.</p>\n<p>Thanks to you I finally have a working collision. :)</p>"
