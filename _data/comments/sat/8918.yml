message: "<p>The code that you emailed me seemed correct however, the project method and the getAxes methods could be causing some problems.  In 3D you typically don't have plane like shapes, usually you work with AABBs (6 sided boxes) and tetrahedrons.  In this case you would use the face normals of the shapes, 6 (or 3) for the AABB and 4 for the tetrahedron.  However, if you use planar shapes then you must include the edge normals as well (like height maps, meshes, etc.)  So if you have a planar AABB, you would have the one face normal and 4 (or 2) edge normals.  Likewise for a triangle you would have one face normal and 3 edge normals.  The edge normals should be the normals of the edge perpendicular to the face normal to be precise (in other words they should lie in the plane of the triangle).</p>\n<p>If I were debugging the problem, I would first make sure my normals are correct.  Then I would verify my project method is working on some simple 3D cases.  Then I would step through the algorithm (looks like your code is good though).</p>\n<p>Also, I have an implementation of the 2D version <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/collision/narrowphase/Sat.java');\"  href=\"https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/collision/narrowphase/Sat.java\" title=\"2D SAT implementation in Java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> in Java.  The Projection class I call <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Interval.java');\"  href=\"https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Interval.java\" title=\"Projection implementation in Java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interval</a> since I use it for other purposes as well.  You may also want to take a look at the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Polygon.java');\"  href=\"https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Polygon.java\" title=\"Polygon implementation in Java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polygon</a> class (the project method would be of interest, just try to ignore the transform stuff).</p>\n<p>If you can send me the project and getAxes code I may be able to help further.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
