message: "<p>Ahhhh, I see.  One more question though.  In some source code I found, the overlap of two rectangles is found by projecting each corner onto each axis.  This is done with the following code:</p>\n<pre>\nprivate int GenerateScalar(Vector2 theRectangleCorner,\nVector2 theAxis)\n{\n  //Using the formula for Vector projection. \n  //Take the corner being passed in\n  //and project it onto the given Axis\n  float aNumerator = (theRectangleCorner.X * theAxis.X) + \n                     (theRectangleCorner.Y * theAxis.Y);\n  float aDenominator = (theAxis.X * theAxis.X) + \n                       (theAxis.Y * theAxis.Y);\n  float aDivisionResult = aNumerator / aDenominator;\n  Vector2 aCornerProjected = new Vector2(\n                       aDivisionResult * theAxis.X,\n                       aDivisionResult * theAxis.Y);\n            \n  //Now that we have our projected Vector, \n  //calculate a scalar of that projection\n  //that can be used to more easily do comparisons\n  float aScalar = (theAxis.X * aCornerProjected.X) + \n                  (theAxis.Y * aCornerProjected.Y);\n  return (int)aScalar;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Its in C#.</p>\n<p>The values are then stored into a list and the minimums and maximums are found and checked for overlap.  Is this the equivalent of doing the dot product of a corner and a normal?<br />\nI found this example here:<br />\n<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/rotatedrectanglecollisions/rotatedrectanglecollisions.shtml');\"  href=\"http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/rotatedrectanglecollisions/rotatedrectanglecollisions.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/rotatedrectanglecollisions/rotatedrectanglecollisions.shtml</a><br />\nif you are interested.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your help and the great comments.  People like you are the reason I'm able to even sort of get a grasp of programming.  I would not be able to do this on my own.</p>"
