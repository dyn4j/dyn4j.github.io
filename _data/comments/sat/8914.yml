This way you don’t have to worry about which way the vector is pointing.\"</p>\n<p>You can´t belive the relief I felt when I read this! I´ve been having serious trouble with the MTV, jitter and tunneling and now it´s all solved. Just like that! :)</p>\n<p>Thank you very much, William! For this and for writing all those great tutorials. Internet owes you. :)</p>"
