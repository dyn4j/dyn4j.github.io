message: "<p>@Mogra</p>\n<p>What this does is make sure that the normal is always pointing from object A to object B.  This is useful, for example, when you try to separate the objects, you know which way to move them.  Which way the normal points, A to B or B to A doesn't matter, but the fact that its consistent does.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
