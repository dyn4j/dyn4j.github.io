message: "<p>@Sam</p>\n<p>You can do collision detection against arbitrary curves, just not using SAT.  SAT is designed for polygonal shapes.  One option would be to implement a line segment shape that you then string together to make a piece-wise curve.  Another option is just to implement a collision detection routine specifically for curves.  <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/37802/collision-detection-with-curves');\"  href=\"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/37802/collision-detection-with-curves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">For example</a>.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
