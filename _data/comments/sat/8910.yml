message: "<p>I have read many articles while coding a java implementation of SAT, using this as my primary. It is only polygon->polygon but that is sufficient for now.</p>\n<p>Since there seems to be a lot of knowledge so far on here so I thought I'd post my question here. I already have some ideas in my head, but other opinions on the matter may sway or change the way I end up dealing with my problem.</p>\n<p>My problem is this. Given that you use the MTV for dealing with collisions, I have come across a problem where the MTV could be 1 of multiple possibilities, i.e. two corners of two rectangles penetrating the same distance in both axes. How should you decide which is the right axes? This isn't of much concern when 2 objects are colliding, but what about 3? And what if one or more objects are moving? say sliding against a wall made up of multiple objects and the movement is at an angle, as the object slides onto the next object forming the wall, if it tests for a collision with THAT object first instead of the object it is / was already colliding with last frame, and it returns the \"wrong\" mtv, it wreaks havoc. By havoc i mean it behaves like there is something in front when there really isn't.</p>\n<p>If it collides with the rectangle to the right first and it gets the mtv for the horizontal axis, it will be pushed back first, causing it to halt forward movement. If i could determine though, that i needed the vertical mtv, it would move up and out first, allowing it to continue its movement.</p>\n<p>The solution I have in my head is to return a list of equal MTV's instead of a single MTV, then deal with it later.</p>\n<p>Or possibly rather, using a supplied movement vector, determine which mtv is more appropriate based on the movement of the shape upon entering the collision? This would cause the same problem though if it is a 45degree angle.</p>"
