message: "<p>Thanks, you are exactly right.  I actually changed the code to initialize the min/max with the projection of the first vertex since that will be more robust anyway.  Can't believe I missed that...</p>\n<p>The else if on line 8 is actually required, otherwise the max would not be the max, it would be the last value that was not less than the min.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
