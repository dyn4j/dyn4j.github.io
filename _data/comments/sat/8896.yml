message: "<p>HI will<br />\nim a student :D and i do not mean to pick or sth.<br />\nreally appreciate your work, helped me a lot.<br />\nbut by definition, a normal vector is one that is perpendicular to another while a unit vector is the one with length of 1.<br />\njust saying finding the normal is not really accurate... would you mind just editing a little bit to make ppl aware of that? even though it will only take them like 1 second to find it on wiki, still its one of the things that make your 99/100 blog post 100/100 :D<br />\nthank you so much</p>"
