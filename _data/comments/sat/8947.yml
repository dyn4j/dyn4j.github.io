message: "<p>\"That axis and that overlap is the MTV, the axis being the vector portion, and the overlap being the magnitude portion.\"</p>\n<p>I'm a bit confused by this part, specifically what is meant by \"vector portion.\"  Do you mean the MTV is a vector in the same direction as the axis, but with a magnitude equal to the overlap?</p>"
