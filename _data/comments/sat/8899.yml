message: "<p>Ok, I see where the confusion is now.  Actually that code there purposefully excludes normalizing the vector.  This is because I save talking about the MTV until later in the post.  (The SAT algorithm can determine if two shapes are intersecting without normalized vectors if you don't need the MTV later.  I think this is probably what's not clear.)  The axes array actually contains a list of normal vectors <strong>not</strong> normalized normal vectors.  Later I add a note in the \"Projecting A Shape Onto An Axis\" section about how the axis needs to be normalized if you want accurate MTVs.</p>\n<p>I have added some additional comments to the post in that section elaborating a little.  Does that address the confusion?</p>\n<p>William</p>"
