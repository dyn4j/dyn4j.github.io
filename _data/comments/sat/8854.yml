message: "<p>Sorry I was away for a while and just now catching up.  You can look at the implementation of the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Interval.java');\"  href=\"https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dyn4j/geometry/Interval.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interval</a> class as an example.</p>\n<p>But if you are anything like me you like to figure things out on your own.  Here is what I would suggest, write down some examples for the different cases:<br />\n(0, 4) and (2, 6) normal case<br />\n(0, 3) and (4, 7) no overlap<br />\n(3, 6) and (0, 2) no overlap, reversed<br />\n(0, 3) and (3, 6) no overlap, \"touching\"<br />\n(0, 7) and (1, 4) overlap, containment<br />\n(0, 2) and (0, 2) same projection<br />\netc.<br />\nand try out your methods.</p>\n<p>For example, the method doesOverlap has some problems with example #3 that I have given since the first condition is true, yet the projections do not overlap.</p>\n<p>As for the getOverlap method I can't really say since I'm not sure what Collider.getDistance is doing, but I'll try to answer.  After the check to make sure the two projections overlap you only need to subtract two of the values:</p>\n<p>For example if the projections are:<br />\n(0, 3) and (2, 30) then we only need to perform 3 &#8211; 2<br />\nLets look at another case:<br />\n(4, 20) and (-1, 7) then we only need to perform 7 &#8211; 4<br />\nLets look at another case:<br />\n(1, 10) and (2, 4) then we only need to perform 4 &#8211; 2<br />\nAnd another case:<br />\n(0, 3) and (3, 5) then we only need to perform 3 &#8211; 3<br />\nLets look at one more case and you may see a pattern:<br />\n(-2, 6) and (-1, 10) then we only need to perform 6 &#8211; -1</p>\n<p>I'll drop in a hint, it involves using max and min.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the compliment btw,<br />\nWilliam</p>"
