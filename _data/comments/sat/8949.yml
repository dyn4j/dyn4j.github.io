message: "<p>Hi William,</p>\n<p>On the off chance you still respond to things on here I have a question.  I am trying to derive the center of the overlapping area of the polygons in the event of a collision.  How can I use the overlapping portions which are not in the x and y plane and determine where the center of my overlap would be in x and y.  I feel like I am on the cusp of it but I keep missing something.</p>\n<p>Here is my matlab attempt:<br />\n<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/ideone.com/RGuYBv');\"  href=\"http://ideone.com/RGuYBv\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://ideone.com/RGuYBv</a></p>\n<p>I couldn't use pastebin so the syntax highlighting is off but hopefully you can understand what I am doing.</p>"
