message: "<p>Once you are in the while loop the algorithm will choose the next direction in the containsOrigin method: d.set(...).  So the only direction you need to choose is the first.  This one can be chosen arbitrarily, but you would want to choose a direction which would allow the algorithm to exit early.  For example, using the vector from the center of shape1 to the center of shape2 is a good option.  This is what I used in the post (Iteration section, before iteration 1).</p>\n<p>William</p>"
