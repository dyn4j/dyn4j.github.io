message: "<p>To make sure there is no confusion on attribution, the video was not mine, but rather the best explanation I had found (Kudos to Casey Muratori for putting it together).</p>\n<p>The triangle case should only have up to 3 ifs, which is two more than the segment case, is this what you are referring to?  If you give me the position in the video (in time) I might be able to answer better.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
