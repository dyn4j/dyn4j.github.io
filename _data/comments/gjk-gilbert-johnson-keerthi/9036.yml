message: "<p>Hi William,<br />\nExcelent post! Could you help me with this question?</p>\n<p>I don't understand how do you get (-0.573, -0.819) from (-336, -480), or how do you get (0.316, -0.948) from (32, -96) in one step. I understand that both pairs have the same reason (x/y), but, how do you exactly calculate those points? And, how do I interpret these points ((-0.573, -0.819) or (0.316, -0.948))? Because I see that you use (-336, -480) or (32, -96) in next iterations.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and sorry but my english isn't very good.</p>"
