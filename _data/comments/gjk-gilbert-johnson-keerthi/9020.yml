Since A is (-8,-2), and AB is defined to be B-A, then AB cannot be (-8,-2) &#8211; (4,2). That would be the definition of BA.</p>\n<p>Personally when I was coding this, this hung me up for a while, until I realized that if you literally do AB = B-A, then in the case of the line simplex, you are actually finding out the vector in the opposite direction of the origin, so this got me an infinite loop since I was always looking the wrong direction. (I spent some time using the right hand rule until I realized what was going on)</p>\n<p>In other words, you did the calculation correctly (A-B) in order to get the perpendicular pointing in the direction of the origin, but the label is wrong, should be BA, and therefore BA X AO X BA.</p>\n<p>(the other triple products are done correctly in the triangle simplex, just this line simplex caused my direction to be looking in the opposite direction of the origin).</p>\n<p>Still, cheers, you saved my butt overall. I had no idea what was going on, even after watching mollyrocket's video twice.</p>"
