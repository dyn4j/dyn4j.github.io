message: "<p>Good question.  In words this is the exit condition because:</p>\n<p>The last point in the simplex is the last point that was added to the simplex.  This point is the <strong>farthest</strong> point in the Minkowski Sum in the given direction.  If the point is not past the origin along <em>d</em> then we know that we can never enclose the origin.  We know that the point is past the origin along <em>d</em> by performing the dot product of the new point with the direction vector.</p>\n<p>Visually, here is a failure case:<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/gjk_29_1.png\" /></p>\n<p>The direction was (-1, 0).  All the points projected onto <em>d</em> gave point <em>p = (1, -4)</em> to be the farthest.  Then we come to the exit criteria where the projection of the point is compared against the projection of the origin.  As we can see the <em>p</em> projected onto <em>d</em>, <em>(-1, 0) &middot; (1, -4) = -1</em>, is less than the origin (the origin projected onto anything is zero).  This makes sense since we have found the point farthest in a direction and the origin is still past that point, and since the Minkowski Sum is convex we know we can never find another point past the origin in this direction.  Therefore we can never enclose the origin and we can immediately exit because no collision was found.</p>"
