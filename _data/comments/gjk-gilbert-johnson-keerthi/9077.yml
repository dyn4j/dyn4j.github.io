message: "<p>@Saad</p>\n<p>An example of a shape similar to a circle is a capsule.  Unless the support direction is perpendicular to the long part of the shape, the farthest point can be found in constant time just like the circle.  An ellipse is just a non-uniformly scaled circle, which means you could also find the farthest point in constant time.  For arbitrary convex polygons, you'd have to find a way to improve the search (using a binary search or something).</p>\n<p>William</p>"
