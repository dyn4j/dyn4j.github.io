message: "<p>I'm both glad that the post helped and sorry that it cause you some debugging grief.  I added a note early in the post clearly stating the definition of AB.  This is actually the accepted notation for a vector that goes from point A to point B.  Mathematically however, the evaluation of that vector is done is opposite order using the difference operator.</p>"
