message: "<p>Yes, that right.  3D should keep a tetrahedron.  The process is the same just a little more complex since you have another dimension to worry about.  Once you have a triangle, you will want to take the direction of the face of the triangle towards the origin to obtain the 4th point.  Then, like you said, find the Voronoi region the origin is in.  If it's inside the tetrahedron then we can return true to indicate a collision.  If it's outside the tetrahedron, then we need to obtain a new search direction.  The new search direction will be the normal of the face in the direction of the origin.  The termination condition can remain the same \"If the new point we found using the support function is not past the origin, projected onto the search direction, then we know that the origin is not in the Minkowski Sum and therefore the shapes are not colliding.\"</p>\n<p>I have not implemented the 3D version of GJK.  If you watched video I linked to at the beginning of the post, it should be pretty easy to formulate the tetrahedron case.   Initially I wouldn't worry about reducing the \"if\" statements down to the minimum until you have something working.</p>\n<p>I know that the opensource project <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.bulletphysics.org/');\"  href=\"http://www.bulletphysics.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bullet</a> has a 3D implementation of GJK (I have a very hard time reading that source code however, probably because my C++ is so rusty, but might have better luck)</p>"
