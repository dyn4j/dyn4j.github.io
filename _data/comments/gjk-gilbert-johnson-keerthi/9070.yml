message: "<p>Hello William,</p>\n<p>This is a wonderful tutorial, thank you very much!<br />\nAbout the function getFarthestPointInDirection(), this seems to require O(n) time for a convex hull composed of n polygons. Are you aware of any algorithms that could speed up this process? Perhaps by partitioning the vertices in some \"directional\" boundaries? I am just wondering what is the best approach for searching for this farthest point? </p>\n<p>Thanks again!<br />\nFrancois</p>"
