message: "<p>@ng:</p>\n<p>I think later in the video he explains that the number of ifs for the triangle case can actually be reduced (I could be mistaken here).  The number of ifs at this stage in the video is around 5-6 depending on how you count it.</p>\n<p>If you think about the AC if and its else condition, you can see that its unnecessary.  We obtain the A and C simplex points by getting the point farthest in the Minkowski Difference along a direction.  We have a check on the loop that says we stop and return no intersection if any simplex point we find is not past the origin along that direction.  Because of this check on the loop, we have already determined that the origin cannot lie in regions 5 and (i think, its hard to read) 6.  If the origin was in either of those regions, then A and C would not have been valid simplex points and we would have exited the algorithm with no intersection already.</p>\n<p>I talk about this in more detail in the <a href=\"http://www.dyn4j.org/2010/04/gjk-gilbert-johnson-keerthi/#gjk-top\" title=\"Checking the Simplex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Checking The Simplex</a> section.  You can also find more talk about the video on this forum thread.  The thread covers a number of improvements which were incorporated into my post here.</p>\n<p>If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask,<br />\nWilliam</p>"
