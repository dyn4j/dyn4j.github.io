message: "<p>Thanks for your answer. I thought that I had to take AO.dot(AB),<br />\nbecause I watched the molleyrocket video and that's the way they explained it.<br />\nIf AO.dot(AB) > 0 it proves you passed the origin on your way from B to A.<br />\nYou take last.dot(d) for the reason you explained.<br />\nBut both tests will always give the same result (I think..)</p>"
