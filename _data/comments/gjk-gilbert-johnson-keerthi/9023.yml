message: "<p>I'm a bit confused about one thing. If the origin lies on the line AB, why is it a contact point? Or are you talking about the bounding line of the Minkowski sum? If the latter is the case, how is that handled? I.e you get a null direction and terminate although the point resides in the Minkowski sum.</p>"
