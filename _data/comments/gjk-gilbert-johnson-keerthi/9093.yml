message: "<p>@LeCoder</p>\n<p>Is the algorithm working as expected without the changes you are trying to make?  Trying to catch just edge-edge collisions will be difficult due to finite precision.  The equals condition will rarely be satisfied.  Instead of changing the code, could you base whether to handle edge-edge collisions on the penetration depth (if its near-zero, for example)?</p>\n<p>William</p>"
