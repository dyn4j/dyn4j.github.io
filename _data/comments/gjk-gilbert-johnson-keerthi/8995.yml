message: "<p>I'm a bit confused. If all I need is to detect if the collision is happening and NOT care about the distance between the two objects A and B, does it mean, with the Minkowski difference giving the boundary of the set(A-B), I only need to determine is the origin is located in side that boundary by doing some dot and cross product of vectors?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>"
