message: "<p>Dear William<br />\n        What an inspiring tutorial! Really appreciate it.<br />\n        I'm wonder how to apply GJK in continuous collision detection? I mean, given a time interval, how to detection the collision between objects during it?<br />\n        Another one, about EPA and Clipping, are there some articles or journals discussing it? Because I want to add it in my paper, hence some obscure mathematical expressions are necessary -_-||<br />\n        Thanks a lot!</p>"
