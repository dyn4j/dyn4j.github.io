message: "<p>@NL</p>\n<p>Yeah, I can see how this could be confusing.  Since the cross product is not commutative and we technically have (AC X AB) X AB then we need to use the triple product expansion:</p>\n<pre>(A X B) X C = -A(C &middot; B) + B(C &middot; A) = B(C &middot; A) - A(C &middot; B)</pre>\n<p>It's a little hard to tell since both B and C in this case are AB.  I've added parentheses to the triple products and added some text that shows the triple product expansion I'm using.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
