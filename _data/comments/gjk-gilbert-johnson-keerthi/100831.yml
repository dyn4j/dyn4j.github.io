message: "<p>William<br />\nThank you for sharing this great articles.<br />\nCurrently i try to implement GJK in particles in 3D space, but i'm really an abecedarian and I have some questions.<br />\nI want to know that how can you know which direction the perpendicular of AB should point? Should i use the righthand law in a 3D space for two times?<br />\nI don't understand the meaning to calculate Simplex.getLast().dot(d).<br />\nI can' find the vidio you mentioned at the beginning.</p>"
