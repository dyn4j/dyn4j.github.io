message: "<p>Hello, William!</p>\n<p>Firstly, thanks for the awesome tutorial! You make it alot more simpler than everyone else does!</p>\n<p>I have GJK almost working, however I've encountered one problem I can't find the source of. I've made a little program for testing it out, in the form of two equal sized squares (80&#215;80) and use the central points to obtain the first direction to check. One square can be moved about in 4 directions and upon detecing a collision, has its speed lowered to a noticable level.</p>\n<p>HOWEVER: in a small perimeter around the static box, the collision because detected as true, even if the box isn't touching. At first I thought this may just be a graphical error, then I noticed the speed is perfectly fine in that perimeter when the box is either in the region diagonal to the static box, or perfectly in line with it. To me, it seems as though the collision detection is going off as if there are extruding lines on the corners of the box, like so: <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/i.imgur.com/C6DDL.png');\"  href=\"http://i.imgur.com/C6DDL.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://i.imgur.com/C6DDL.png</a></p>\n<p>I'm unsure on their length since I haven't tested it that much, but it seems to be having that effect (I noticed it when I move the box in to this field and moved it parallel to the edge of the box, when the moving box suddenly jolted, as if it was free of the invisible grasp).</p>\n<p>Any idea what's causing this? I thought it might be me just getting some >'s mixed up with some >='s or something, but if it is, I haven't pinned down which one.</p>\n<p>Dunno if you still watch this post but there's no harm in asking, ha.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>"
