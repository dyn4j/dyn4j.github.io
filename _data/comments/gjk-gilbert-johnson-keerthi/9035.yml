message: "<p>Yes.  You can create a line segment and make sure its past the origin before beginning the while loop for a slight performance improvement.  </p>\n<p>The goal of this post was to introduce the topic and explain the algorithm.  I tend to leave small improvements like this out because they tend to lose the reader.  Once the reader understands the algorithm, these types of improvements are usually obvious.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
