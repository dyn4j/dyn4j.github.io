message: "<p>Dear William, as I applied the GJK in 3d environment, based on the OpenCascade , following your gorgeous tutorial, I realized that defining the support function for complex solid shapes is the most difficult problem I have to deal with. For I'm working on designing the continuous collision detection module for a CAD platform.<br />\nWould you please give me some advice or recommend some textbook or materials to me? Thanks a lot!</p>"
