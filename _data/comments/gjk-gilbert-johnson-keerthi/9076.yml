message: "<p>Right. You kicked off by mentioning that the advantage of GJK over other algorithms (e.g., SAT) is that it works for any shape that implements a support mapping. For a random convex polygon, the support takes time linear in the vertex count; for a circle it takes constant time. Intuition says that there are shapes for which the support takes time proportional to <strong>log n</strong> or something. My intuition tells me that there should be a fast way of computing the support for a regular convex polygon (in part because the more vertices it contains the better it approximates a circle). I should probably formalize this and come up with a formula for doing so.</p>"
