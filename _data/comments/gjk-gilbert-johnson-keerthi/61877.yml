message: "<p>@Joe</p>\n<p>I think you are comparing the GJK post and the GJK distance post?  If so, that's true, they are different in a lot of ways.  I think I was trying to convey that they use the same concepts, while the implementation may be different.  These articles also have a good bit of history so could use some updating.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
