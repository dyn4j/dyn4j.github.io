message: "<p>hi, william</p>\n<p>In 2D, we keep simplex a triangle, if we only keep simplex a tetrahedrold in 3D?<br />\nso I think how to remove a vertex from tetrahedrold,...<br />\n1.first judge orign if in the voronoi area of 4 vetices. if it is in these area, it'll no collision, for simplex vertices are vertices of minkowski difference shape.<br />\n2. jude orgin if in the 4 face voronoi area, if in a face voronoi area,  we will choose direction of voronoi and remove vertex opposite this face.<br />\n3. otherwise, orgin in internia of tetrahedrod, it's collison state.</p>\n<p>is my idea right? if you supplement a 3D simplex checking, it will be perfect.</p>"
