message: "<p>Hi William<br />\nits really quite simple. My data provides for both time and coordinates. I just correlate at what coordinate there is a collision with the corresponding time. Anyway, I found my mistake and now I get the same time of collision same for both algorithms. However, I have a small question about the triple product. In the post you have written to find ABPerp as ACxABxAB but shouldn't it be ABxABxAC, as you have rightly written in the formula.<br />\nRegards &amp; Thanks!</p>"
