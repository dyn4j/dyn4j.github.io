message: "<p>Great questions!</p>\n<p>An easier way to calculate the triple product is using the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product#Vector_triple_product');\"  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product#Vector_triple_product\" rel=\"nofollow\">triple product expansion</a>.</p>\n<p>The triple product obtains the vector perpendicular to the vector AB in the direction of the origin by the <strong>handedness of the coordinate system</strong>.  Most coordinate systems use the right hand rule, which means to (literally) line your index finger up with the first vector, in this case AB, then line up your middle finger with AO, then whatever direction your thumb is pointing, that will be the direction of the result.  Then you line up your index finger with the last result and line your middle finger up with AB, then the result is in the direction of your thumb.  This is how the triple product obtains the correct direction.  Take a look at the image <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/phys345/Fall1998/class/1-right-hand-rule.html');\"  href=\"http://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/phys345/Fall1998/class/1-right-hand-rule.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for an example of what I mean.  In our case we have to use the right hand rule twice because there are two cross products.</p>\n<p>The result of <em>vector x AB</em> can return two different vectors depending on the direction of <em>vector</em>, in our 2D case, <em>vector</em> can be pointing out of the plane or into the plane.</p>\n<p>As you point out, in 2D you could simply get either the left or right normal easily by switching the x and y values and negating one, then check if you have the right direction by projecting it onto AO and negating if necessary.  This is because there are only two perpendicular vectors to choose from.  However, for 3D you must use the triple product because there are an infinite number of vectors perpendicular to AB.</p>\n<p>William</p>"
