message: "<p>Hello William,</p>\n<p>I watched the video tutorial and read through. In the video, the third line of initialization should negate D (it reads D = -S in the video but his explanation is correct). I'm implementing a 2D version of GJK and have a question.</p>\n<p>I think that the cross product direction update can be made faster by just rotating the vector AB in the direction of the origin. What do you think?</p>"
