I understand  how  &#8216;C_dot' has been derived ( quite obvious ) but the  jacobian &#8212; J =   [-I -r1_skew I r2_skew ]    is too misty for me. ( pardon me if it is obvious but  I am unexperienced  about these stuff ). Could you help me with the derivation of the jacobian-matrix for this case ?<br />\nAlso, why are they taking a different equation for the angle-constraint &#8212;<br />\n\"<br />\n// Angle constraint<br />\n    // Cdot = w2 &#8211; w1<br />\n    // J = [0 0 -1 0 0 1]<br />\n    // K = invI1 + invI2<br />\n\"<br />\nwhy not accomodate it in the previous constraint itself?<br />\nAlso,  I  don't see any place where they have made use of the  friction-coefficient  between the bodies.</p>"
