message: "<p>Hi, I am trying to implement Pulley joint in a physics simulator. This post has been very helpful.<br />\nCould you derive the expression for (del_J / del_t) i.e. the time derivative of the jacobian matrix.<br />\nMy implementation is giving very erratic behaviour which I suspect is because of the incorrect value of<br />\ntime-derivative of the jacobian-matrix.</p>"
