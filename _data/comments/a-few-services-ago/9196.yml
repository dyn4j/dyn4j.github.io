message: "<p>Wow, that is really cool! I especially like that you noticed the logical aspect concerning proofs. I never noticed it that way :) It's like two birds with one stone, Jesus says the truth and Jesus is God. Plus I love those verses because they show how the new testament is inspired, and that the authority of Jesus is on the same level as the Father.</p>"
